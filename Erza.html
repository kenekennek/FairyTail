						<h1>Erza Scarlet</h1>
						<p>Erza is a very strict person, often criticizing the bad behavior and habits of the other guild members, causing most of them to apologize, fearing that they might invoke her wrath. She is also very impatient, disliking people who don't answer her questions quickly enough. This, coupled with her own tragic childhood, caused many of her guildmates to avoid her due to her social awkwardness. However, she has a great sense of justice and pride in being a member of Fairy Tail. </p>
						<p>Erza describes herself as someone who was always crying, since she wasn't able to protect those dear to her. Several examples are when Rob tried to shield her from destruction, and when Jellal was captured because he saved her and was brainwashed by "Zeref". Also, Erza has stated that she feels uncomfortable and insecure when she's not wearing armor. However, when Erza encounters Ikaruga, she overcomes her fear and defeats her without her armor. </p>
						<p>If rising up from the pit of slavery and beating up her first crush because he's brainwashed, and gaining her magic abilities by watching the death of the first positive role model in her life doesn't convince you that Erza Scarlet can challenge Batman for badass of the year. Then nothing will convince you my friend. She also only has the one eye, the right one's artificial due to torture while enslaved as a child.</p>
